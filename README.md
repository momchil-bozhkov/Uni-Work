# Uni-Work

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of coding tasks completed during my studies at university. It is organized into branches, with each branch representing a distinct programming language. Within
each branch, coding tasks are further categorized into folders based on the subject or module they pertain to. Each folder contains the source code, relevant resources, and a detailed README file providing an
overview of the task, instructions for execution, and any additional notes or dependencies.
